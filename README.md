# MDT_FPGA-GPU_pipeline

This repo is meant for sharing the software pipeline developed for the
Deuterium Telescope (Mauritius), commonly known as MDT. The hardware for the
digital back-end consists of parallel computing platforms: FPGA, multi-core CPU
and GPU.

The FPGA directory contains the DAQ system design, made with Simulink, for the
FPGA. It was done using Matlab R2018a and Vivado 2019.1.1.
