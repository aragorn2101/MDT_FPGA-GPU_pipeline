# MDT_FPGA-GPU_pipeline

This repo is meant for sharing the software pipeline developed for the
Deuterium Telescope (Mauritius), commonly known as MDT. The hardware for the
digital back-end consists of parallel computing platforms: FPGA, multi-core CPU
and GPU.

The FPGA directory contains the DAQ system design, made with Simulink, for the
FPGA. It was done using Matlab R2018a and Vivado 2019.1.1.

**NOTE:** the file mdt_snap_10ch_daq.pdf is much larger than A4. It is known
that certain pdf reading software have trouble to open it. Some software do
open it but does not allow sufficient zoom so that the small details can be
seen. The software which are known to work are Okular (on KDE) and xpdf.
